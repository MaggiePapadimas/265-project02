# 265-project02

I decided to make a hangman for this project. You can guess, start a new game, and give up by saying it out loud. The more points you have the more "views" you get, and vise versa. The sentences are used from the essay itself.

I had fun doing this. I thought this was an interesting take for this project. It has everything asked for; interactive and makes you think about the essay.
