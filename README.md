# 265-project02

I decided to make a hangman for this project. You can guess, start a new game, and give up by saying it out loud. The more points you have the more "views" you get, and vise versa. The sentences are used from the essay itself. i took different video titles for the words to guess. for the body i made different parts of known characters in reference to the video "different heads on wrong body" video on the article.

I had fun doing this. I thought this was an interesting take for this project. It has everything asked for; interactive and makes you think about the essay.
